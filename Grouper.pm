=head1 NAME

Data::Grouper - Perl module to aggregate data for use with template
modules.
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS


   my $grouper = new Data::Grouper(
                   COLNAMES => [ 'STYLE','COLOR','DESCR','PRICE'],
                   SORTCOLS => [ 'STYLE','COLOR' ]
                  );

   $sql = 'select category, subcat, description, price from order_items order by style, color';
   $aref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);
   $grouper->add_array($aref);

   $t = HTML::Template->new(filename=>'../foobar.htmlt');
   $t->param(OUTER=>$grouper->get_data());
   print $t->output;

Lazy?  Me too.  The DATA param can use only two calls:

   $sql = 'select category, subcat, description, price from order_items order by style, color';
   $aref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql, {Slice=>{}});

   my $g = new Data::Grouper(DATA=>$aref,SORTCOLS=>['STYLE','COLOR']);

   $t = HTML::Template->new(filename=>'../foobar.htmlt');
   $t->param($g->get_data());
   print $t->output;
   
And the fragment from the HTML::Template code:

   <TMPL_LOOP NAME=OUTER>
        <h1>Style: <TMPL_VAR NAME=CATEGORY></h1>
      <TMPL_LOOP NAME=INNER>
        <h2>Color: <TMPL_VAR NAME=SUBCAT> </h2>
          <table>
          <TMPL_LOOP NAME=INNER>          
            <tr><td> <TMPL_VAR NAME=DESCR></td><td><TMPL_VAR NAME=PRICE></td></tr>
          </TMPL_LOOP>
          </table>
      </TMPL_LOOP>
      <tr><td>&nbsp</td><td><TMPL_VAR NAME=SUM_PRICE></td></tr>
   </TMPL_LOOP>

This might produce output like:

  Toys
    Nerf Toys
      Nerf Dart Gun                  20.00
      Nerf Footbal                   30.00

                                     50.00
  Video Games
    X Box
      Gothic Something or Other      10.00
    Playstation 2
      Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec          15.00
      Grand Theft Auto 3             10.00
      
                                     35.00
                                     
This is not my most inspired example ever.  Except for the PS2 bits.

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This is a helper object for the various templating modules
that exist.  A key feature of any templating system is
the ability to deal with loops of data, for example
rows in a table.  Most systems will deal with nested
looping.  Data::Grouper takes the work out of
prepaing the data structures for nested loops.

Grouper will help you the most if you are writing reports
that have multiple layers of grouping with aggregate  values
but also need to display the detail rows.  An SQL select statement will 
get you one or the other of these features, but not both at
the same time.  And you still have to construct your data
structure for HTML::Template.  Grouper does it all.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Most of the behavior of grouper is determined by the parameters
passed to the constructor.

=over 4

=item *

COLNAMES - define column names for use with TMPL_VAR

Tell grouper the column names.
These are used when creating the hashes for HTML:Template.  COLNAMES
should contain the names of the hash values in the order the values
will appear in the rows passed to add_row().
So for the following code:

   COLNAMES => [ 'RESP_DESC','DUTY_ID', 'DUTY_DESC']

The hashes in the output structure will have keys RESP_DESC, 
DUTY_ID, and DUTY_DESC.  This allows them to be used in 
<TMPL_VAR> directives.

If you are using add_hash or add_array with an array of hash
references, you may omit COLNAMES.  If COLNAMES is omitted,
the keys of the first incoming hash will become the contents
of COLNAMES.  Keep in mind that these are case sensitive.

=item * 

AGGREGATES - Columns for which totals should be computed

This parameter gets a reference to an array of column names
to compute aggregate functions on.  Aggregate functions are
the same as you would find in SQL: sum, avg, min, max.

At every level of grouping, aggregate values will be provided.

Aggregate values are automatically given names based on the 
aggregate function and the column name.  Specifically, one of 
SUM_, MIN_, MAX_, or AVG_ is prepended to the column name.

Top level aggregates are contained in a hash obtainable with the
get_top_aggregates() function.

=item * 

SORTCOLS - Columns to group on

This parameter is a reference to an array of column names to
sort on.  The number of <TMPL_LOOPS> in your template
will be equal to the number of column names you indicate here.

The rows passed to grouper MUST BE SORTED on the columns
indicated in SORT_COLS.

=item *

DATA - Array ref of hash or array refs

If you are using selectall_arrayref and not modifying the data before
sending it to grouper, you can reduce your grouper code to two calls
by using the DATA parameter in the grouper->new() constructor:

   my $g = new Data::Grouper(DATA=>$aref,SORTCOLS=>['STYLE','COLOR']);
   $g->get_data();
   
This will often be your best approach.

=item *

FORMAT - Formatting Functions

 my $cr = sub { sprintf "\$%.2f", shift; };
 my $g = new Data::Grouper( 
                  FORMAT=> { 'Count'=>$cr, 'SUM_Count'=>$cr }
                  );

This parameter is a reference to a hash from column names (as
specified in COLNAMES) to formatting functions.  A formatting
function takes one parameter and returns the formatted value
of that parameter.  Such a function might be used, for 
example, to format money values.

=back 4

=head2 add_array

DBI can return entire arrays with selectall_arrayref.  This
function lets you just pass an array ref in instead of doing
a while loop and calling add_row for each row.

   $aref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);
   $grouper->add_array($aref);

Just like add_row, add_array expects that the data is sorted
on the columns that are specified in SORTCOLS.

=head2 add_row

This takes a list of scalar values, which should correspond to the
entries in COLNAMES, and puts it in the correct 
place in the data structure.  Data in the successive calls to 
add_row is expected to be sorted on the columns specified in
SORTCOLS.

One reason to use add_row over add_array is if some transformation
happens between retrieving the data and populating the data
structure.

=head2 add_hash

This takes a hash ref as a parameter.  The has is assumed to contain 
the keys from COLNAMES.  If COLNAMES was not specified, the keys
from the first has are used.  Grouper makes its own copy of the 
hash ref.

=head2 add_details

Sometimes you will want to add some additional information
to a row or a parent.  This function helps you do that.

I'm not certain this function is useful and will stay.

=head2 get_data

This function returns the array refernces required for
the call to HTML::Template's param() function.

=head2 get_top_aggregates

This function returns a reference to a hash containing top level aggregates
for the data.  Top level aggregates are contained in their own separate
hash since aggregates are normally one level up in the data structure from
the array containing their rows, but in the case of the top level, it is
impossible to go up one level.

Some top level aggregates may be best computed outside of Data::Grouper.
For example, while Grouper could maintain a count of total rows, if 
you were using add_array this statistic is just the size of the array,
which is computed much more efficiently as $#array.

Right now G::D computes top level aggregates if any aggregates are being
computed.  In the future there may be an option to disable computation
of top level aggregates.  Actually, they should probably be disabled by
default.

=head1 More Examples


Suppose you have a table of book data with columns genre, title.  You might
have this data:

 Non-Fiction, Techincal, Effective Perl, 25
 Non-Fiction, Technical, The C Programming Language, 20
 Non-Fiction, Techincal, Lex & Yacc, 20
 Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Book of Five Rings, 13
 Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Against Method, 30
 Fiction, Sci-Fi, Lord of the Rings,25
 Fiction, Sci-Fi, Foundation,15
 Fiction, Literary, Gravity's Rainbow,15
 
Say you want to display these, grouped by genre.  You need to build

 @data = [
   { FICTION=> Non-Fiction,
     INNER => [
       { GENRE => Technical,
         INNER => [  { TITLE=>Effective Perl, PRICE=>25},

If you are getting your data from a database, you might do this:

 $sql = 'select fiction, genre, title from books order by fiction, genre';
 $aref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);
 $grouper->add_array($aref);

Grouper creates the array of hash refs, containing array refs with hash
refs that H::T requires.


=head1 FAQs

=head2 How is this different than GROUP BY in SQL?

SQL's group by facility allows grouping at only one level and
does not provide the underlying detail data.  Grouper is used
to provide summary details at multiple levels while still providing
the underlying data, all in a format you can use with HTML::Template.
